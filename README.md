This repository hosts development of a stand-alone version of the lock-free
Wimmer k-priority queue (pheet.org).

Running benchmarks
==================

Several benchmarking tools are provided, with the most heavily used and
maintained one being the random throughput benchmark (src/bench/random.cpp).
The simplest way to run benchmarks is by using the provided wrapper script:

```bash
$ make && ./bench.py -a klsm128,klsm256 -p 1,2,3,5,10,15,20 -r 5 -o results.csv
```

Figures can then be generated by running:

```bash
$ Rscript misc/plot.R results.csv && ls -lha fig.png
```

Dependencies are of course required but should be simple to determine either
from error messages or the scripts themselves. Most scripts and binaries may be
called with the standard '-h' argument for help.
